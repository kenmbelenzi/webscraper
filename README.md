# Webscraper
 This is a project that uses webscraping to get twitter usernames from https://africafreak.com/100-most-influential-twitter-users-in-africa and https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/africasource/african-leaders-respond-to-coronavirus-on-twitter/#east-africa.
 I then used the usernames to get their tweets using tweepy .The tweets are then used to rank the users and get most common hastags and tweets used by them.
